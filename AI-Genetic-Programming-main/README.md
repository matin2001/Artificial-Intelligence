Function approximation with the help of genetic programming
One of the applications of GP is approximation of functions. In this application, each member of the population represents a mathematical expression that is displayed in the form of a tree. The middle elements of this tree are mathematical, logical or any user-defined operators and the leaves of the tree contain constant values and input variables. The purpose of this application is to estimate the mathematical formula of an objective function. The objective function is a Black Box and the only thing we know about it (or can obtain) is to obtain the value of the function at arbitrary points. In this way, we find the value of the function at an arbitrary number of points and call them the training set. For each tree, according to the values it obtains for the training points and its difference with the actual values, a merit value can be assigned and based on that, the evolutionary algorithm can be followed.
