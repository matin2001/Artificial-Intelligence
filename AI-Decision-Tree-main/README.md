# AI-Decision-Tree
We want to implement the decision tree.
In the first step, the decision tree is implemented for discrete data. For the implementation test, 12 data of a restaurant are tested. In the second step, the data related to the diagnosis of diabetes are used. This data is delivered in a file called diabetes.csv. In this database there are examples with 8 features and a binary output. Its purpose is to diagnose the presence or absence of diabetes with the help of these 8 entries.
