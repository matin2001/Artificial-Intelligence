# Artificial-Intelligence

This repository hosts a collection of AI projects demonstrating various machine learning techniques:

  1. AI-Decision-Tree-main: Implements decision tree algorithms for classification and regression tasks.
  2. AI-Genetic-Programming-main: Explores the use of genetic programming to solve optimization problems and automate solution generation.
  3. AI-SVM-main: Utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) for robust classification and regression analysis.

Each project includes detailed documentation and examples to guide you through the implementation and application of these AI methods.
