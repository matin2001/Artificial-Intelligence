# AI-SVM
We will use ready-made SVM tools and libraries to learn about SVM classification capabilities.
Part 1:
First, we design some two-class problems from very simple to very complex. For example, we consider a number of points in two-dimensional space and assume that some points are members of class 1 and others are members of class-1. Then we proceed to classify fake data with SVM. We test without cores, with different types of cores, different parameters for each core, etc.
Part II:
First, we need to choose a database for ourselves. Preferably select image database do it We divide the selected database into two parts, train and test, and perform the training phase on the train set, and then obtain the classification accuracy with SVM in the test data.
